This workshop will be semi-structured with interview questions and will last 60-90 minutes. There will be 3-4 participants all above the age of 18 but probably under the age of 25 as they will be students recruited from Imperial College's campus. During the workshop, the participants will be asked questions that reveal how much they know about emotional privacy and how important it is for them online. I will be developing a prototype for this project that introduces noise into users' online activity, increasing their privacy. This focus group will be asked questions about which features they would like to see or think are important with such a product in order to help me develop a prototype that users actually want/need.

There is very little research about what internet users think about emotional privacy, and speaking to some users will give me insight into the design specifications I may wish to adopt for my project.

My project at large will hopefully educate and inspire everyday internet users who come across my research to be more careful with their online privacy. 

This method is best suited to this stage of my research because it is a good way to gather key insights in a short period of time. These insights can later be validated with surveys etc., but they lack the depth needed for initial exploration.

No risks as the workshop will be held online so it will be COVID-secure.

No.

I will ensure all participants are called by their preferred names/pronouns and that they all feel their opinion is valued.

The focus group session will be held over Zoom/Microsoft Teams and it will be recorded to facilitate qualitative data extraction. The participants names/other personal information will not be saved. This recording will be deleted after the completion of the project.
