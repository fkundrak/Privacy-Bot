Master project idea: a piece of software that completely corrupts your data by scrolling or “watching” things on social media without you having to do anything. <br>
Maybe even searches for things on the internet. <br>
	• How do we ensure it doesn’t do anything illegal (search for how to make a bomb) or embarrassing (like your ex’s instagram pics)? <br>
	• How would this work with amazon echo? Would you effectively have to have a speaker that ‘speaks’ to it? Or a plugin to distort your voice’s pitch, speed, rhythm? How could we make voice data completely flat and 2D? <br>
	• Can be sold as a remedy to screen addiction: we could prove that we would make insta/fb/TikTok feeds no longer relevant to them, so they would not be tempted to scroll through them. Especially good for instagram because you want to see your friends’ posts but not spend hours scrolling through reels
