How realistic is it? <br>
Create taxonomy of what data is being collected and how is it being collected? <br>
Privacy policy can give you the data source you want to corrupt <br>
Adding random noise to a data strain such that they cannot invade your privacy <br>
You need to understand exactly how that app is interacting with your system? Accelerometer? GPS? Camera? Microphone? <br>
This app would have to be in the middle of operating system and social media add <br>
'Spoofing the trackers' <br>
Is the bot open-source? <br>
You would need login credentials and would work on case-by-case basis <br>
For ALL apps, you would need to get very close to the operating system <br>
How do you spoof? Do you make it completely random? Do you try to make it look like your regular engagement pattern? <br>
Would this be a product or a feature of an existing operating system e.g. Apple? <br>
From a demo point of view, app plus login is more feasible <br>
What are the characteristics of the spoof you want to deliver?  <br>
What are the consequences of giving them something fake? What are the effects of it? Does it change you??? <br>
They are designed for engagement  <br>
Need to speak to someone who developed these kinds of algorithms <br>
Recommender algorithms e.g. Netflix <br>
What they say they want to collect vs what they actually collect - count app requests <br>
Need a measurement framework (before vs after) <br>
How much screen time is too much? Is there research on it? <br>
Stakeholder engagement - what do people want? How much screen time? <br>
Apple - before and after introduction of screen-time widget <br>
Mindful engagement  <br>
Might be worth focusing on social media because it is not essential <br>
Wikipedia effect? <br>
Do not limit autonomy with this app - user configurability - maybe a slider to control how much noise is introduced? <br>
Introducing a noise signal - read differential privacy literature - anonymizes data. 
Can then tailor the mathematical distribution to the particular application.
