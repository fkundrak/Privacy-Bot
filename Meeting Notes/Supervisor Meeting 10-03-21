No need for external ethics approval for just the workshop as long as I'm just looking to find out people's wants/needs & just deriving knowledge, 
qualitative research. 
If observing the world as it already exists. 
Not asking people to change, just asking for their opinion. 
Define who the stakeholders are - what is the most interesting group for this project?  
Narrow group down a bit to get some amount of consensus   
Could compare young and middle aged participants. 
Surveys are qualitative data, quantified. Quite shallow, but more people e.g. 50. 
Interviews are more in-depth. 
You can probe issues there and then. 
Workshops are the best way to start if you don’t know much about the area - surveys are good to confirm findings on large group of people. 
Depends on level of detail I am interested in with this stage of research. 
Envivo free through imperial college which is a software for qualitative data - removes bias   
For focus group: use zoom, create little blurb for whose brains you want to prick. 
Cascade and invite people to workshop. Avoid friends and family because they will tell you exactly what you want to hear. 
Use MailChimp to sign up. As a last resource reach out to students you know but you have to be open about this in your report.  
Nejra will help me come up with a set of questions just before the meeting(s). 
Need about 10 important questions, but may not get through all of them.  
Let people know you're recording and that data will be anonymized.   
Sometimes you need to warm people up because they may be shy. Sometimes you need to explain things e.g. emotional privacy.  
Don’t need more than 3-4 people per focus group otherwise too busy
