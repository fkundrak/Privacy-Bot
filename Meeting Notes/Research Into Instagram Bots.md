- Instagram bots violate Instagram's Terms of Use "You must not access Instagram’s private API by means
other than those permitted by Instagram. Use of Instagram’s API is subject to a separate set of terms."  
- Could result in being banned or 'shadow banned", whereby your posts don't show up to discover page. 
This is obviously bad for businesses but not so bad for individuals wanting increased privacy/decreased screen time. 
- Instagram focuses on banning bots that auto-like, auto-comment, and grows your followers. No evidence of them looking 
out for bots that scroll/linger on posts (probably because they don’t really exist). 
- Some Instagram automation is allowed - scheduling posts, customised analytics, monitoring tools etc.  
- Some bots using AI use image detection to determine what the content of posts are - this, combined with hashtags, 
could be a good way of ensuring a range of seemingly 'random' posts are 'looked at'.
