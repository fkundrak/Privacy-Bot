1. What do you already know about emotional privacy? In a digital context?
  -2 Not something I've thought much about, have not come across it much digitally, only time I've come across it is if I've filled out a survey etc. or filling out a doctors note. I don’t mind because you're in control over what you tell someone 
  -1 I would be quite careful who I would tell this about, I don’t think many people will care or be interested in it.
  -3 Privacy is very important, I wouldn't share my internal feelings with the world.
  -1 Who does the advertising benefit? If it offers me something to help me or is neutral, it does not bother me at all, would rather be shown something targeted than something irrelevant.
  -3 Easy to scroll past it so it doesn't bother me that much.

2. How much control do you like to have over your privacy? Do you actively make choices to improve your control over your privacy?
  -2 I like to keep it as private as I can, I have my web browser set to private, I don’t like how things you say in conversation pop up in conversation. Social media accounts are all private as can be because it's just my business.
  -3 My accounts are not private because I only show non-private things but the content is very general not related to private life.
  -1 My opinion fluctuates a lot regarding cookies etc.- if it does not and cannot harm me then why not. I have faith it's not collected for malicious purposes. In my understanding, data is anonymized so they can't trace it back to me anyway. Try to keep personal info private for fraud prevention prupo0ses .

3. Does the amount you care about privacy fluctuate? If so, what could these fluctuations be due to? Do they just coincide with the news?
  -2 Definitely linked to the news, will change my behavior but it's only ever short term.
  -1 agreed
  -3 agreed

4. Do you like having personalized/tailored ads on social media? Do you often make purchases based on them?
  -2 Contradictory - I want relevant ads but don’t want them to know what I am actually into. If it's v specific e.g. white dress I don’t mind it. 9/10 times it is harmless.
  -3 At the beginning I was a bit shocked - I thought they were going to spy on me. Now I'm taking advantage of it because they know I am refurbishing a house so get shown relevant ads. There's nothing I can do about it so might as well make the most of it.
  -1 It's creepy but it doesn't adversely affect me. I think society has just decided that it's creepy. 

5. What is the context that is important for privacy vs where is it less important? E.g., ads based on googling vs something else. Cross-platform tracking? What crosses the line? What makes you feel comfortable or uncomfortable?
  -2 I don’t like seeing things to do with health and medication on social media because I don’t trust it, I google it instead because I trust it. I don’t like seeing things about relationships like 'perfect Instagram relationship'. I use google for medical things for ease of access but will only use trusted websites like the NHS.
  -1 Will it change the way people treat me? If not, I don’t mind. My data is impersonal.
  -3 I would be very annoyed if something came up to someone I actually know. 

6. Think about the effect on YOUR health not public perception of you? Have you ever been caught in an unpleasant echo chamber?
  -2 I still feel okay about it because I don’t have anything I'm trying to avoid seeing at the moment. Actually, it does annoy me about the perfect Instagram relationships. I want a button to say I don’t want to see this content again.
  -1 I don’t think they'll be able to get away with always listening. If they're trying to exploit the consumer that's not okay.
  -3 I think it's all exploitative. I think the idea of amazon Echo listening is terrible. Which part of my room is Echo not listening?
  -All 3 participants like 'positive marketing' i.e. marketing of harmless consumer products like clothing.
  -1 2 3 We would all like a button to blacklist a topic because we would all be shown really random things.
  -1 Could have a negative algorithm - this person has said they don't like this specific advert, good to have negative feedback

7. What do you understand about cookies? And pop-ups? Do you toggle website cookies off or leave them on? If you switch them off, do you switch them all off or just a few that are most important to you? 
  -2 Don’t know anything about cookies, I always just close the box so I don’t have to think about it even though it doesn’t actually reject them.
  -1 Most websites use cookies before you even click accept. Started out rejecting all the cookies, but now I'm just tired and close the box every time. The worst thing they can do is show the person collecting which websites you have been on. 
  -3 I don’t know about them - I know they're related to privacy and I try to avoid but will accept if I have to. It takes too long to reject all individually.
  -1 At the end of the day, if you're hosting a website it should be your choice.
