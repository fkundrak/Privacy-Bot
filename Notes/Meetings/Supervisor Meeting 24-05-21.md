These are neutral terms, do the same with negatively loaded terms - go for 20 again to have a fair comparison       
Example of first transition for neutral and negative terms (or first, second, last)     
Is there a damping effect of the randomness bot - run it for an hour, save 25 posts, then run it for another hour, and then you can meaningfully make the conclusion that it works     

Neutral without bot, negative without bot, neutral with bot, negative without. If it works, can comment of level of distortion.     
Is there a difference between neutral and negative terms.     

Would be interesting to calculate entropy - how long until there are no more cats etc     
Long many iterations until no cat (or nothing that can be mistaken for cat)      
E.g. takes an average of 5 searches until the effect of the first term dissipates
