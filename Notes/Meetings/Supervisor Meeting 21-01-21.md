How realistic is it?      
Create taxonomy of what data is being collected and how is it being collected?      
Privacy policy can give you the data source you want to corrupt     
Adding random noise to a data strain such that they cannot invade your privacy      
You need to understand exactly how that app is interacting with your system? Accelerometer? GPS? Camera? Microphone?      
This app would have to be in the middle of operating system and social media add      
'Spoofing the trackers'      
Is the bot open-source?      
You would need login credentials and would work on case-by-case basis      
For ALL apps, you would need to get very close to the operating system      
How do you spoof? Do you make it completely random? Do you try to make it look like your regular engagement pattern?      
Would this be a product or a feature of an existing operating system e.g. Apple?      
From a demo point of view, app plus login is more feasible      
What are the characteristics of the spoof you want to deliver?      
What are the consequences of giving them something fake? What are the effects of it? Does it change you???      
They are designed for engagement      
Need to speak to someone who developed these kinds of algorithms      
Recommender algorithms e.g. Netflix      
What they say they want to collect vs what they actually collect - count app requests      
Need a measurement framework (before vs after)      
How much screen time is too much? Is there research on it?      
Stakeholder engagement - what do people want? How much screen time?      
Apple - before and after introduction of screen-time widget      
Mindful engagement       
Might be worth focusing on social media because it is not essential      
Wikipedia effect?      
Do not limit autonomy with this app - user configurability - maybe a slider to control how much noise is introduced?      
Introducing a noise signal - read differential privacy literature - anonymizes data.      
Can then tailor the mathematical distribution to the particular application.
