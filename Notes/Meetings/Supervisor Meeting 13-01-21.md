These are the notes from the first meeting after the literature review, where the next steps of the project were discussed including a potential for a physical embodiment.

Emotion scrubbing from audio signals - removes emotions from echo     
What do you need to be able to deduce things by proxy? Tone of voice, agitated? Gender, emotional state etc.  
So company only gets bare bones minimum     
Reach out to David Boyle to understand what is technologically feasible.   
Data disruption     
Try and figure out what people have done already      
Who is doing things like this      
Talk to David about technical viability? Would it mess up your feed etc?       
Social media addiction? Infinite scroll?      
Validation study - measure anxiety for eg when scrolling, measure change in anxiety with this plugin      
Does this result in increased awareness? Reduced anxiety? Easily measured and tested      
Does it mess with experience so much that people don’t want to use it?      
Duck duck go - check out their transparent advertising model      
Scrambling your data      
Initial focus group with different age groups      
Show embodiment and validation to show that you have DONE the work      
Who’s done something similar?     
What do we know? What don’t we know?      
Is it viable? What parts are viable? In what contexts?      
App development      
User validation - could also include phycological testing     
How can these things be done?     

For interim report:      
Gantt chart - v detailed      
Preliminary mock-ups      
What are the important things we are trying to prevent?      
Peoples’ perception of privacy invasion?      
Branded as a tool for productivity?? That needs to be validated separately     
What do users actually want? Switch? Software? Plugin?      
Where do you want this to go and what do you want to get out of this?      
Is there a link between perceived levels of privacy and levels of anxiety?      


My own thoughts through the meeting:      
How to instagram bots work?? How do they take control of your account/feed
