Milestones for the bot:

	1. Download all necessary drivers etc. for the GitHub 'like bot'.   
	2. Run the 'like bot' from GitHub, make sure it works and has no bugs. Runs fine, why does it stop after 1 like? FIXED.  
	3. Test that feeding hashtags of one category to the 'like bot' creates a timeline of associated posts. Does changing the hashtag change the timeline?    
	4. If step 2 is true, alter code to create a 'save bot', where posts of a certain hashtag are saved not liked.   
	5. Again, test that the 'save bot' affects the timeline.    
	6. Next, find a BIG list of hashtags, and write a script that will randomly select a hashtag from that list. Perhaps use the categories that Instagram/fb/google have for interests as the hashtags themselves (e.g. #fitness). https://voymedia.com/facebook-interests-list/     
	7. Add this to the 'save bot', which should now be a randomised privacy bot.    
	8. Confirm that the bot does no more saving than Instagram's hourly limit (probably same as the hourly limit for liking).
